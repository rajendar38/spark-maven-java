Hi everyone 👋

I’m running multiple SparkApplications on Kubernetes (using the Spark Operator), and I’m trying to expose each Spark UI through Istio.

Right now, each Spark UI is always served at the default root path /, so when I route through an Istio VirtualService (e.g. /spark-app1, /spark-app2), the context path /spark-app1 just forwards to / inside the driver service — which causes 404s or routing conflicts.

Is there any way to change or configure the Spark UI base path (context path) for each SparkApplication, so that each app can be served under a distinct route (like /spark-app1, /spark-app2) instead of /?

If not, what’s the recommended pattern for running and exposing multiple Spark UIs behind a single ingress (e.g., Istio Gateway)?

Thanks in advance!
