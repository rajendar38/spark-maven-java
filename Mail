hhhhope you are doing well.

I wanted to discuss my current immigration situation. I have been working with Wipro for the past two years on H-1B status, and I am now at a stage where initiating the PERM and I-140 process is important for my H-1B extension planning and long-term continuity.

I have recently received another offer where the employer is willing to immediately start the PERM and I-140 process. Before making any decision, I wanted to check with you whether Wipro can initiate the green card process at this time.

I truly value my experience here and would prefer to continue with the organization if there is a possibility to begin the process soon. Please let me know if we can schedule a discussion regarding this.

Thank you for your time and support.
