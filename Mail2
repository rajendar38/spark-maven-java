Dear [HR Name],

I hope you are doing well.

I wanted to discuss my immigration situation and long-term plans with the organization. I have been working with Wipro for the past two years, primarily supporting the US Bank account. Effective February 27, I have been tagged to the UHG account.

As I am currently on H-1B status, initiating the PERM and I-140 process is important for my H-1B extension planning and long-term stability in the U.S. I have recently received another offer where the employer is willing to immediately start the PERM and I-140 process. Before making any decision, I wanted to check if Wipro can initiate my green card process at this time.

I sincerely value my experience at Wipro and would prefer to continue contributing here, especially as I transition to the UHG account. However, due to immigration timelines, I need clarity on whether the process can be started soon.

Please let me know a convenient time to discuss this further.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards,
Rajendar Talatam
