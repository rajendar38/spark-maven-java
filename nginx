io vs Ingress-NGINX: What’s Happening, Why It Matters, and How to Migrate Safely

Kubernetes networking has gone through a major shift in recent years.
One of the biggest changes came with the announcement that the
Ingress-NGINX controller is retiring in March 2026, leaving many teams
unsure about their future traffic management strategy—especially
clusters running both Ingress-NGINX and Istio.

This article explains the retirement, how to check whether your cluster
depends on Ingress-NGINX, and how Istio can become your complete,
future-proof replacement.

1. Background: What Is Ingress-NGINX?

Ingress-NGINX has been the default and most widely used Kubernetes
ingress controller for years. It translates Kubernetes Ingress resources
into NGINX routing rules so external traffic can reach internal
services.

Teams chose it because it was simple, reliable, and widely supported.
But it also had major limitations: growing security vulnerabilities, low
maintainer bandwidth, overly flexible annotation mechanisms, and
technical debt.

These issues ultimately led to its official retirement announcement,
effective March 2026.

2. Why Ingress-NGINX Is Being Retired

The Kubernetes community cited several reasons for ending development:

-   Security concerns: recent critical CVEs highlighted design issues
    that were difficult to fix.
-   Lack of maintainers: only a handful of volunteers were maintaining a
    project used by millions.
-   Growth of modern alternatives like Istio, Gateway API, Envoy
    Gateway, and Traefik.
-   Technical debt: the annotation model created uncontrolled
    configurations that were hard to audit.

3. What About Clusters That Already Have Istio?

If your cluster uses Istio, this is the best possible scenario.

With Istio installed:

-   You don’t need Ingress-NGINX at all
-   Istio provides its own IngressGateway
-   Routing is done with Gateway + VirtualService
-   Istio provides strong security, mTLS, traffic control, and rich
    routing

In simple terms:

-   Ingress-NGINX = Old, basic, being retired
-   Istio IngressGateway = Modern, powerful, supported, future-proof

4. How to Check If Your Cluster Depends on Ingress-NGINX

Run:

    kubectl get ingress -A

If you see no results, you are not using the old Ingress mechanism.

To check if Ingress resources use the NGINX controller:

    kubectl get ingress -A -o yaml | grep ingressClassName

If it shows:

    ingressClassName: nginx

Then those workloads must be migrated.

5. If No Workloads Depend on Ingress-NGINX — Remove It

To clean the cluster:

    kubectl delete ns ingress-nginx

Or:

    helm uninstall ingress-nginx -n ingress-nginx

6. How to Migrate Workloads from Ingress-NGINX to Istio

Convert each Ingress into:

-   a Gateway
-   a VirtualService

Before (NGINX Ingress)

    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: app
    spec:
      ingressClassName: nginx
      rules:
      - host: app.example.com
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: app
                port:
                  number: 80

After (Istio Gateway + VirtualService)

Gateway:

    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
    kind: Gateway
    metadata:
      name: app-gw
    spec:
      selector:
        istio: ingressgateway
      servers:
      - port:
          number: 80
          name: http
          protocol: HTTP
        hosts:
        - "app.example.com"

VirtualService:

    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
    kind: VirtualService
    metadata:
      name: app
    spec:
      hosts:
      - "app.example.com"
      gateways:
      - app-gw
      http:
      - route:
        - destination:
            host: app
            port:
              number: 80

7. Should You Switch to Gateway API Instead?

If you do not need full Istio service mesh features, you can migrate
directly to a Gateway API controller such as:

-   Istio (supports Gateway API)
-   Envoy Gateway
-   Traefik
-   HAProxy

But if you already run Istio, staying with Istio’s Gateway makes the
most sense.

8. Final Recommendation

If your cluster has Istio:

-   Stop using Ingress-NGINX
-   Migrate all Ingress objects to Istio Gateway + VirtualService
-   Delete the old NGINX controller once migration is complete

You will end up with a cleaner cluster, a supported routing system, and
no dependency on a retiring project.
